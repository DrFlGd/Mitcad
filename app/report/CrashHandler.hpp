// Crash capture for error reports (mitcad#62), in the application and in
// its worker processes (the import worker, mitcad --import-worker, and the
// render worker mitcad-render). Plain C++ without Qt, so that the handlers
// do nothing a crashed process cannot do: on Linux and macOS signal
// handlers (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGABRT) that write with
// write() and backtrace_symbols_fd(); on Windows an unhandled exception
// filter that walks the stack from the fault (StackWalk64, on a thread of
// its own) and a SIGABRT handler with CaptureStackBackTrace, both naming
// the frames' functions from the PDB file next to the executable where
// there is one (dbghelp's SymFromAddr; without it the executable's frames
// keep their offset in it, never the name of a nearby exported function).
// An uncaught C++ exception (std::terminate; on Windows the unhandled
// exception 0xE06D7363, CXX_EXCEPTION, which is read before anything
// unwinds) and a Rust panic (noteMessage, before the abort that follows
// it) leave their message in the report: an exception's type and its
// what() (mitcad#773).
//
// A report is a text file `crash-<time>-<pid>.crash` in the crash folder
// (setDirectory; a worker takes it from MITCAD_CRASH_DIR, which the
// application sets for its children): a header of `key: value` lines, the
// stack (`stack:`), the recent actions (`actions:`). The application reads
// it with report::parseCrashReport (ReportText.hpp) and offers it on its
// next start, or at once for a worker of its own (ReportCenter).
//
// The process still crashes as it would have: the handler writes the
// report, puts the default action back and raises the signal again.
//
// OCCT's own handlers (geometry::catch_occt_crashes) come later and keep
// what is crashes inside OCCT's operations; the rest comes here.
