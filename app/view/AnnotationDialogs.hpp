// The dialogs that edit annotations (mitcad#702, app/COMMANDS.md
// "Annotations"): the editor of one (double-click in the view or in the
// Annotations window, Edit…) and those that change several at once from
// the window (Colour…, Group…, Decimals…, Tolerance…); and those that ask
// for a new datum label's letter and a feature control frame's tolerance.
// Each gives the fields of a command that change, or nothing when it was
// cancelled or nothing changed; the caller runs it.
//
// Each logs, for UI tests, "<title> dialog opened: <what it starts with>"
// and, on OK, "<title> dialog: <the change as JSON>".
