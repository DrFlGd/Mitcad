// Never again for the same design: the user hiding every body and showing
// one again (the light bulbs, an isolation left) had the view fit that one
// body alone, and the bodies shown after it were out of sight (found in the
// bundle check of mitcad#529/#530, tools/ui-browser-test.sh's quick light
// bulbs). The view only gets the shown bodies, so it cannot tell a hidden
// body from none; the window arms the fit when it installs a design.
