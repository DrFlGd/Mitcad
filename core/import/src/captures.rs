//! The file's captured positions (`Snapshot` items, mitcad#75; what the
//! decoder gives: SCHEMA.md §5.3 `Snapshot`) as Mitcad's
//! `capture_position` features, and where they leave the occurrences.
//!
//! A captured position lists occurrence paths from its component with
//! their placements in that component. The transforms the file stores for
//! the occurrences are older than the captured positions: the joints and
//! as-built joints of the file hold at the captured placements, not at the
//! stored transforms, also those before the captured position *(the
//! designs read)*. So the file places an occurrence at the end of its
//! timeline at its last captured placement, else at its stored transform
//! ([`Captures::final_placement`]); the occurrences take those as their
//! own placements ([`Captures::last`]), and each captured position comes
//! in at its point of the timeline.
//!
//! The items before an occurrence's first captured position were made
//! with it at its stored transform, and those between two captured
//! positions with it at the earlier one: where the import moves geometry
//! from one component's coordinates into another's (a sketch of one
//! component used by an item of another, faces of other components as
//! planes), it takes the placements at the item's point of the timeline
//! ([`Captures::placement_at`], mitcad#86), not the ones the occurrences
//! start at.
//!
//! A path level whose occurrence the decoder does not find (the file names
//! some top-level occurrences in captured positions by other ids than
//! their own) is the occurrence that places the component the next level
//! sits in, where one occurrence does; the same id elsewhere is then that
//! occurrence too. Levels inside components of other documents are left
//! out, and so are grounded occurrences (Mitcad does not move them).
