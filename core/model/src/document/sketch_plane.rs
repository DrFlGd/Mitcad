//! Redefine Sketch Plane (mitcad#787): a sketch moved to another plane or
//! planar face, and placed there by an offset along the normal, a move in
//! the plane, a rotation about the normal and a flip (`placement.rs`). The
//! sketch keeps its geometry in its own 2D coordinates; its linked
//! projections and sections follow their sources from the new plane at the
//! next evaluation (or say why they cannot), and the features built on it
//! follow it. One undo step (`sketch.redefine_plane` in commands.md).
