// The analytic surfaces and curves of a dressup's B-spline faces and edges
// (mitcad#328). Where OCCT's fillet walks a rounding (a ball rolling on a
// narrow face's far edge, the port's edge overflow, or a rounding along a
// walked one), it builds the rounding as a B-spline surface and its edges
// as B-spline curves even where they are exactly a cylinder, lines and
// circles. The bodies the files store have the cylinder there, and a
// rounding later run along those faces fails in OCCT's walk on the
// B-splines and builds on the analytic ones.

// keep their names, the shape its notes. Null when nothing converts, a face
// of the result is closed on a seam, or a converted face does not check
// valid (the result then stays as OCCT built it). `exact` widens that
