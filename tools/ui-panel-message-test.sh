# A command panel's errors in its narrow page (mitcad#198), through the
# real UI, in the Docked and the Floating layout, editing a 20 mm cube's
# Extrude:
#   - a long unknown name typed as its distance: the note under the field
#     has a word far wider than the panel, and the panel stays as wide as
#     its page (wider, its right side with the fields and OK and Cancel
#     would be cut off);
#   - a distance of 0: the preview's error in the message, within the
#     page's width; 10: the message hidden, its room given back; 0 again:
#     the error shown again.
# Long words in the message itself and many lines of errors, bounded and
# scrolling, are in the unit tests (app/tests/command_message.cpp).
#
# Runs headless on Xvfb (see ui-test-lib.sh).
# Usage: tools/ui-panel-message-test.sh
