# A dragged Extrude's preview meshes (mitcad#635) through the real UI, on
# the synthetic block of the ticket that mitcad-cli makes: 120 x 100 x 20
# mm with 83 through holes of 4 mm, and a 20 x 10 mm rectangle at (50, 45)
# on a plane 20 mm up (its top), whose Extrude joins it (a body of 94
# faces). With MITCAD_MESH_TRACE=1:
#   - a typed distance previews in the interactive tier ("Display meshes
#     of preview: 2 bodies ... (interactive)"), the 88 faces the Join keeps
#     taken from the block as shown, only the top and the boss meshed
#     ("Mesh trace preview interactive: ... 88 faces reused, 0 faces from the
#     result store; faces=... kept=88
#     meshed=11"); once no input changes, the bodies themselves are meshed
#     in the final tier and drawn ("refining the display meshes of 2
#     bodies", "display meshes refined");
#   - a drag of the distance's arrow previews in the interactive tier while
#     the button is held and refines once it is released;
#   - OK keeps the final meshes; undo and redo show the block and the
#     joined body again;
#   - the view never meshes a plane of the perforated body itself, on the
#     UI thread: no "mesh-trace: presentation" line with a plane of 84 or
#     85 wires, from the opening to the end.
#
