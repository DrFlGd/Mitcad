# Extrude's preview in a design of components placed off the origin, with
# hidden bodies and occurrences and a linked component, through the real UI
# (mitcad#266):
#   - Board:1 (O1, at 60, 0, 0) with a shown body F2.b0 and a hidden body
#     F3.b0; Part:1 (O2, at 0, 80, 0), a component linked from another
#     design file; Part:2 (O3, at 0, -80, 0), hidden.
#   - Extrude on a root sketch: the preview ("Preview bodies: ...", what it
#     draws and where) draws Board's and Part's bodies where the view shows
#     them, the new body in the root, no component's body at the design's
#     origin, and neither the hidden body nor the hidden occurrence.
#   - OK; then with Board active, Extrude on Board's own sketch: the new
#     body is drawn where Board:1 puts it, still nothing at the origin and
#     nothing hidden drawn.
#   - The design with Board:1 isolated: Extrude on the root sketch draws
#     Board's body and the new one, not the linked body outside the
#     isolation.
#
# Runs headless on Xvfb (see ui-test-lib.sh).
# Usage: tools/ui-preview-placement-test.sh [screenshot.png]
