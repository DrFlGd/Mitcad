# Sketch Dimension's angle between two lines measures the sector the value
# is placed in (mitcad#296), on a trapezoid mitcad-cli makes: Sketch1 (F1)
# on XY, its bottom c1 from (0, 0) to (40, 0) (fixed), c4 up to (30, 20), c6
# across to (10, 20) and the left side c8 from (10, 20) down to the corner
# (0, 0). The bottom's and the left side's directions make 116.57 degrees,
# the trapezoid's inner corner 63.43.
#   1. The bottom and the left side picked, the value placed inside the
#      corner: the value editor offers 63.43 (not 116.57); 60 entered, the
#      side turns to 60 degrees and the arc runs inside the corner, from the
#      bottom (0 degrees) to the side (60 degrees).
#   2. The same lines, the value placed in the neighbouring sector, between
#      the bottom's extension and the side: the supplement, 120 degrees
#      (driven: the corner is held), its arc from 180 to 60 degrees.
#   3. The saved design has both sides.
#
# Runs headless on Xvfb (see ui-test-lib.sh).
