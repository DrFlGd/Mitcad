# A dimension is typed without a click into its field (mitcad#338), on a
# design mitcad-cli makes: Sketch1 (F1) on XY with one fixed line c1 from
# (0, 0) to (40, 0).
#   1. Offset starts with the Curves selection, so the view has the
#      keyboard; once c1 is picked the Offset Position field gets it, with
#      its text selected: "12" typed and Enter (no click into the field)
#      offsets c1 by 12.
#   2. A click into the field is the user's choice: a later pick in the
#      view does not take the keyboard back from it (the typed text stays
#      where the user put it).
#   3. A drawing tool already has the keyboard in its first on-canvas
#      field: the circle's centre clicked, "30" typed and Enter (no click)
#      adds a circle of diameter 30.
#   4. Starting and cancelling Offset retires the Dimension tool's value
#      editor: a later Enter and view click cannot add a dimension.
#
# Runs headless on Xvfb (see ui-test-lib.sh).
# Usage: tools/ui-sketch-field-keyboard-test.sh [screenshot.png]
