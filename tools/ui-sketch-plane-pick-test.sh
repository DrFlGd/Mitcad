# Create Sketch waiting for a plane (mitcad#474), through the real UI, in
# the Docked and the Floating layout, on a block and a cylinder:
#   - the view's banner "Create Sketch: pick a plane or a planar face. Esc
#     cancels." shows while the mode lasts and below the cards floating
#     over the view's top; the MCP's ui_state reports it as its hint, the
#     status line beside it;
#   - a click on the cylinder's side, which cannot take a sketch, says so
#     (not planar, a cylindrical surface) and logs "Create Sketch: refused
#     pick"; the banner stays and no sketch starts;
#   - the browser's Design Policy... is refused with what the window waits
#     for, not "Finish the command or the sketch first.";
#   - Esc ends the mode and the banner; a planar face still starts the
#     sketch after a refused pick.
#
# Runs headless on Xvfb (see ui-test-lib.sh).
# Usage: tools/ui-sketch-plane-pick-test.sh
