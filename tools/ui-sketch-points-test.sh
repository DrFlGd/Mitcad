# Points that become one and projected geometry made ordinary, through the
# real UI, on a design mitcad-cli makes: Box1 (F1.b0, 30 x 20 x 10 from 20
# above XY, its front at y = -60) and Sketch1 (F2) on XY with two collinear
# lines with a gap (c1 from (0, 0) to (10, 0), c4 from (20, 0) to (30, 0)), two lines
# whose ends are apart (c7 from (0, 30) to (20, 30), c10 from (24, 34) to
# (24, 50)) and the box's front top edge projected, linked (c13 from p14 at
# (0, -60) to p15 at (30, -60)).
#   1. Extend c1 (mitcad#259): its end joins c4's start p5, two degrees of
#      freedom fewer.
#   2. Coincident on c7's end and c10's start (mitcad#260): one point; Offset
#      of the two lines works (one chain); undo takes both back.
#   3. Convert to Sketch Geometry (mitcad#257) from the context menu of the
#      projected line: before it the line does not drag, after it it does;
#      undo makes it projected again.
#   4. On a second design (mitcad#287): a rectangle standing on a projected
#      line, its bottom Horizontal and its left corner on the line's left
#      end; Coincident on its right corner and the line's right end is
#      added, the Horizontal it implies removed, and the hint says so; one
#      undo takes both back.
#   5. The Point tool on a derived offset curve: the point is added, the
#      coincident of its snap is refused, and the hint shows why.
