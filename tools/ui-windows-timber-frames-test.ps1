# Input-driven Windows UI test of frames of timber members and slot
# profiles with the BUILD tab's Timber and Profile (mitcad#485, mitcad#492),
# in the build VM (tools/ui-windows-lib.ps1 says how the input is posted),
# with the synthetic library of tools/ui-windows-timber-lib.ps1 (mitcad#834:
# once part of tools/ui-windows-timber-test.ps1):
#   1. A frame of four members with shared mitres (mitcad#485): each on the
#      end of the one before, turned at a corner, lying flat as it does
#      (ends of the same width); the last one's auto length bound to the
#      first closes the corner with a shared mitre, as long as the first
#      one's outer side.
#   2. The same frame of slot profiles with Profile, the last one's length
#      through the first: a shared mitre, not into it.
#   3. The timber frame again, the last one's length typed to the first's
#      outer side: it closes the corner with a shared mitre too (mitcad#492).
#   4. A board along X on the ground rests on it (its axis 24 mm up); a
#      member standing on its top face from end A at offset 0 lies as it
#      does: its width along the board's, its sides flush (mitcad#492).
